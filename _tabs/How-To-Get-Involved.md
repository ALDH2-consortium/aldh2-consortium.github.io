If you are a researcher working with, or leading, a cohort in East or Southeast Asia (e.g., Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea, Cambodia) and you are interested in joining this Consortium, please email chloe.slaney@bristol.ac.uk and kindly complete this form [this form](https://forms.office.com/e/Xgf2LNfqpu). A draft protocol and principles of collaboration are expected to be ready in ~ May/June 2026.

**NOTE: To be involved, cohorts are required to have ALDH2 genotype data available *and* phenotype data for at least 1 of 3 key aims (listed below)**. 

## Data Required:
### Aim 1: Examine the potential *causal* effect of maternal alcohol use during pregnancy on risk of pregnancy complications and adverse offspring health using Mendelian randomization. 

**Necessary Data: Only maternal *ALDH2* genotype data is necessary, along with at least one phenotype below.**

### Aim 2: Investigate the interaction between maternal alcohol use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and *ALDH2* genotype (maternal and child), on pregnancy and offspring outcomes. 

**Necessary Data: Maternal and/or child *ALDH2* genotype data is necessary, information on maternal alcohol use during pregnancy, and 1+ phenotype(s) (listed above).** 

### Aim 3: Investigate the role of *ALDH2* genotype on risk (and if available, severity) of infectious disease. 

**Necessary data: *ALDH2* genotype on any cohort participants with infection data are required**. For example infectious diseases, please see below. However, please not that in secondary exploratory analyses, we will include a broad range of child and adult infectious diseases, so please do include all infectious disease data available in your cohort when completing the expression of interest form, thank you very much!
